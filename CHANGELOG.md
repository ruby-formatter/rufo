- Allow new Ripper node :excessed_comma in block parsing
- Allow :bodystmt in lambda nodes to suit Ripper format in 2.6.0

## [0.2.0] - 2017-11-13
### Changed
Config parsing and handling:
- No longer using `eval` to parse config files
- Warnings have been added for invalid config keys and values

The default for the following options has changed:

Valid options for:
- trailing_commas: `[:always, :never]` > `[true, false]`
