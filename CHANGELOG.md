## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

### Added

- Add rubocop-config-rufo to README.

## [0.4.2] - 2019-01-22

### Fixed
- Fix bug: Rufo indents squiggly HEREDOC incorrectly causing bad formating (issue [136](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/136))

### Added

- Chore: Added ruby 2.6.0 to CI test runs.

## [0.4.1] - 2018-10-27

### Fixed
- Fix bug for double colon operator in method definition (issue [#120](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/120))

## [0.4.0] - 2018-08-09

### Fixed
- Fix Bug: Rufo breaks HEREDOC syntax. (issue [#88](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/88)). This fixes heredoc within parens formatting causing bad formatting and subsequent syntax error.
- Fix Bug: formatter.rb:3700:in `block in adjust_other_alignments': undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError) (issue [#87](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/87)). Check alignment target exists.
- Fix Bug: Rufo keeps switching formatting on same file every time it runs (issue [#86](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/86)). Avoids re-indenting nested literal indents.

### Added
- Allow for simpler else_body node to suit new Ripper style in 2.6.0
- Allow new Ripper node :excessed_comma in block parsing
- Allow :bodystmt in lambda nodes to suit Ripper format in 2.6.0
- Drop support for ruby 2.2
- Set minimum required ruby version. As rufo is not tested on unsupported versions it may (and is known to) break code.

## [0.3.1] - 2018-04-12

### Fixed
- Fix `quote_style` config not being respected (issue [#95](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/95)).

## [0.3.0] - 2018-03-24

### Added
- Added Idempotency check to source_specs/ tester.
- Normalize string quotes according to quote_style, which defaults to :double.

### Fixed
- Fix printing of extraneous trailing semicolons from inline classes, modules, methods (issue [#59](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/59))
- Fix unhandled white space between array getter/setters `x[0] [0]` (issue [#62](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/62))
- Fix comma printing for heredocs when inside a hash (issue [#61](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/61))
- Fix array literals against changes to Ruby 2.5.0

## [0.2.0] - 2017-11-13
### Changed
Config parsing and handling:
- No longer using `eval` to parse config files
- Warnings have been added for invalid config keys and values

The default for the following options has changed:
- parens_in_def: `:dynamic` > `:yes`
- trailing_commas: `:dynamic` > `true`

Valid options for:
- trailing_commas: `[:always, :never]` > `[true, false]`

### Removed
The following configuration options have been **removed**, and replaced with non-configurable sane defaults, [per discussion](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/2):
- align_assignments
- align_comments
- align_hash_keys
- indent_size
- spaces_after_comma
- spaces_after_lambda_arrow
- spaces_around_block_brace
- spaces_around_dot
- spaces_around_equal
- spaces_around_hash_arrow
- spaces_around_unary
- spaces_around_when
- spaces_in_commands
- spaces_in_suffix
- spaces_in_ternary
- spaces_inside_array_bracket
- spaces_inside_hash_brace
- visibility_indent
- double_newline_inside_type
- spaces_around_binary

### Fixed
- Fix crash in Ruby <= 2.3.4, <= 2.4.1 in the presence of certain squiggly doc (`<<~`) with multiple embedded expressions. The real fix here is to upgrade Ruby to >= 2.3.5 / >= 2.4.2
- Fix dedent bug and bad formatting caused by comments within chained calls (issue [#49](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/49))
- Fix formatting bug for `for i, in [[1, 2]] ; x ; end` (issue [#45](https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo/issues/45))
